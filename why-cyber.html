      <p class="blog-date">Published: July 2025</p>

      <article class="blog-content">
        <p>I chose cybersecurity because I want to protect — not just systems, but people, ideas, and communities who depend on technology every day.</p>

        <p>Growing up, I witnessed how fast tech was transforming lives across Africa. But with that growth came new threats — scams, identity theft, data leaks. I knew then: someone had to stand guard. I wanted to be that someone.</p>

        <p>Cybersecurity is more than coding. It's about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Thinking like an attacker 👾</li>
          <li>Solving complex puzzles 🧠</li>
          <li>Understanding both technology and human behavior</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What excites me most is the purpose. It’s not just a career — it’s a mission to build trust and resilience into the digital world.</p>

        <blockquote>
          "I don’t just want to stop cyber threats — I want to build a future that’s safe by design."
        </blockquote>

        <p>My goal? To be the kind of professional that businesses and communities can count on. The kind who leads, who defends, and who helps others grow safely online.</p>
