      <article class="blog-content">
        <p><strong>Opening Linux for the first time</strong> felt like lifting the hood of a car and seeing its engine. Suddenly, the system came alive — the commands, the file structure, the raw control over everything.</p>

        <p>Linux taught me <strong>discipline</strong>: how to navigate using the terminal, install packages manually, manage permissions, and deal with failures without a GUI. It humbled me. But it also sharpened me.</p>

        <blockquote>"Linux doesn’t just run systems. It builds system thinkers."</blockquote>

        <p>Compared to Windows, Linux demands intention. Every command has a consequence. Whether it's writing bash scripts, analyzing log files, or configuring cron jobs — you're forced to learn the “why” behind the action.</p>

        <p><strong>As a cybersecurity student</strong>, this is essential. From penetration testing with Kali to handling forensic logs, Linux is where most real-world security work happens. It’s not just a skill — it’s a culture.</p>

        <p>I now use Linux daily for everything from writing code to spinning up virtual labs. It’s the command line where I found both my frustration and my growth.</p>
