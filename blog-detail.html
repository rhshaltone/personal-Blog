      <p class="blog-date">Published: July 2025</p>

      <article class="blog-content">
        <p>My journey into cybersecurity started with curiosity â€” I wanted to understand how digital systems work and how they can be protected. In my first year, I dove deep into the fundamentals of computer networks, operating systems, Linux, and even ethical hacking tools like Kali Linux.</p>

        <p>What surprised me most wasnâ€™t just the technical depth, but the mindset shift. Cybersecurity isnâ€™t just about code or firewalls â€” itâ€™s about thinking critically, anticipating threats, and being constantly aware of how systems can be misused.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve faced real challenges: learning how to use the terminal efficiently, troubleshooting broken configurations, and understanding complex topics like encryption and authentication. But these moments have shaped my growth. Every error taught me something valuable.</p>

        <p>My proudest achievement so far? Hosting a mini awareness campaign on cyber hygiene at school, where I designed posters and shared tips on safe browsing, password security, and phishing threats.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, Iâ€™m excited to explore penetration testing, digital forensics, and contribute to open-source security projects. This is just the beginning.</p>
