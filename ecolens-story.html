      <article class="blog-content">
        <p>EcoLens started as a creative way to showcase my friend‚Äôs stunning nature photography ‚Äî but it grew into something more. I realized that with code, I could help raise awareness about the environment and inspire others to protect it.</p>

        <p>Using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I built a dynamic gallery where images aren‚Äôt just viewed but experienced ‚Äî with categories, hover effects, and upload features. It became a canvas for environmental storytelling.</p>

        <p>Beyond the visuals, EcoLens reflects a principle I believe in: using tech to amplify good causes. This project taught me not just design or coding, but how digital platforms can inspire change.</p>

        <p>In future versions, I plan to integrate a map view, blog sections, and even community uploads. It‚Äôs not just a gallery ‚Äî it‚Äôs a mission.</p>
